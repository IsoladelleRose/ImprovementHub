# Deploy Spring Boot Backend to Railway

## Your Database Status âœ…
- PostgreSQL 17 with SSL is ready
- Image: `ghcr.io/railwayapp-templates/postgres-ssl:17`

## Step 1: Deploy Backend Service

### Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cd ImprovementHub
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add PostgreSQL integration and Railway configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **In Railway Dashboard**:
   - Go to your project (where you created the PostgreSQL database)
   - Click "New Service"
   - Select "GitHub Repo"
   - Choose your ImprovementHub repository
   - **Important**: Set root directory to `/backend`

3. **Railway will automatically**:
   - Detect it's a Spring Boot application
   - Build using Maven
   - Deploy your backend service

### Option B: Railway CLI

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd ImprovementHub/backend

# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your existing project
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

After deployment, in your **backend service** (not database):

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
2. **Click on your Backend Service** (not the PostgreSQL service)
3. **Go to "Variables" tab**
4. **Add this variable**:
   - **Name**: `DATABASE_URL`
   - **Value**: `${{ Postgres.DATABASE_URL }}`

This connects your backend to your PostgreSQL database using Railway's private network.

## Step 3: Verify Deployment

### Check Logs:
1. In Railway dashboard, click on your backend service
2. Go to "Deployments" tab
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. Check logs for:
   ```
   Started ImprovementHubApplication
   ```

### Test API Endpoints:
Your backend will be available at: `https://your-backend-service.up.railway.app`

Test with:
```bash
# Replace with your actual Railway backend URL
curl https://your-backend-service.up.railway.app/api/partners

# Should return an empty array [] if working
```

## Step 4: Database Tables Auto-Creation

When your Spring Boot app starts successfully, it will automatically create:
- `partners` table
- `ideas` table
- All necessary indexes

Look for these logs:
```
Hibernate: create table partners (...)
Hibernate: create table ideas (...)
```

## Step 5: Get Your Backend URL

After successful deployment:
1. In Railway dashboard, click your backend service
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Copy the "Public Domain" URL
4. This is your API base URL for the Angular frontend

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
- Check that `/backend` is set as root directory
- Verify `pom.xml` is in the root of the backend folder
- Check deployment logs for errors

### If database connection fails:
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set
- Check that both services are in the same Railway project
- Ensure PostgreSQL service is running

### If tables aren't created:
- Check application logs for Hibernate statements
- Verify `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` in properties
- Look for any SQL errors in logs

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. âœ… Backend deployed and running
2. âœ… Database connected and tables created
3. ðŸ”„ Update Angular frontend to use Railway backend URL
4. ðŸ”„ Test complete flow: Frontend â†’ Backend â†’ Database
5. ðŸ”„ Deploy Angular frontend to Railway (optional)

## Your Backend API Endpoints

Once deployed, your API will be available at:
`https://your-backend-service.up.railway.app`

### Partner Endpoints:
- `POST /api/partners/register` - Register new partner
- `GET /api/partners` - Get all partners
- `GET /api/partners/{id}` - Get partner by ID

### Idea Endpoints:
- `POST /api/ideas/register` - Register new idea
- `GET /api/ideas` - Get all ideas
- `GET /api/ideas/wants-help` - Get ideas wanting help
